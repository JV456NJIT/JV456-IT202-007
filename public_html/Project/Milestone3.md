<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Since my app is fairly small this was pretty easy. I just made<br>a table that holds a users id and an events id for every<br>event that the user wanted to add to their list. Creating the add<br>to attending function was very similar to the remove event function for admin<br>so just a few edits to the code for that and it was<br>good to go.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Document any issues/struggles</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This was fairly easy as far as adding association but I was not<br>able to complete the other aspects of this Milestone such as removing association,<br>allowing admin to view associations/remove associations/add associations manually. I did have a hard<br>time trying to figure out how to display multiple events for a specific<br>user.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Highlight any favorite topics</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>All of the aspects of this project were pretty interesting. Figuring out how<br>data gets passed from either one page to another or from API to<br>database was probably my favorite part. It helped me understand what all the<br>extra inputs on a URL are for and what they do.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Overall how do you feel you did with the project and meeting requirements</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I think I did decent at best. I should have dedicated more time<br>to the project so that I could hit all the milestones completely especially<br>for milestone 3 where I fell short by a lot. There were some<br>things that I do think were not necessary for my project, most of<br>which are the things that I did not get to do for Milestone<br>3 such as having an admin see all the events associated with a<br>user and not associated with a user.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Summarize your experience per the checklist items</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had no development experience at all when i came into this classroom,<br>at least not any web dev experience. As a CS major I have<br>experience writing code in C/Java/C++/Python etc but none for HTML/PHP and very little<br>for SQL. I feel really good about my overall experience, I think having<br>a background in some programming in general allowed me to either understand what<br>I needed to do and how the code would work right away or<br>understand what I needed to research to get my code to work. It<br>also allowed me to be able to read the professor&#39;s code and figure<br>out how information is being moved around. The only thing that I would<br>do differently is probably apply more time to the project, it wasn&#39;t very<br>hard, but I underestimated the difficulty of it in general especially for debugging<br>aspects.<br></p><br></td></tr>
